"""
Project Euler Problem 31
========================

In England the currency is made up of pound, -L-, and pence, p, and there
are eight coins in general circulation:

  1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, -L-1 (100p) and -L-2 (200p).

It is possible to make -L-2 in the following way:

  1 * -L-1 + 1 * 50p + 2 * 20p + 1 * 5p + 1 * 2p + 3 * 1p

How many different ways can -L-2 be made using any number of coins?
